Linux files have read (r), write (w), execute (x) permissions for user, group, others.

Check permissions:
ls -l file.txt

1 Change permissions:

# Symbolic method
chmod u+x file.txt       # Add execute to user
chmod g-w file.txt       # Remove write from group
chmod o+r file.txt       # Add read for others

# Numeric method
chmod 755 file.txt       # rwx for user, r-x for group/others
chmod 644 file.txt       # rw- for user, r-- for group/others

2 File Ownership (chown, chgrp)
Change file owner:

sudo chown newuser file.txt

Change group:
sudo chgrp newgroup file.txt

Change both owner and group:
sudo chown newuser:newgroup file.txt

3 Getting Help
man command        # Detailed manual
whatis command     # Short description
info command       # More detailed than whatis
command --help     # Quick help

4 TAB Completion & Up Arrow Keys

TAB â†’ Auto-completes commands or filenames.
cd Doc<TAB>   # Completes to Documents/

5 Adding Text to Files
# Using echo
echo "Hello World" > file.txt      # Overwrite
echo "Another line" >> file.txt   # Append

# Using text editors
vi file.txt
nano file.txt
6 Pipes (|)

Pipe sends the output of one command as input to another.

cat file.txt | grep "error"
ls -l | sort -k5

7 File Maintenance Commands
touch file.txt       # Create empty file
rm file.txt          # Remove file
mkdir dir_name       # Create directory
rmdir dir_name       # Remove empty directory

8 File Display Commands
cat file.txt         # Display file content
tac file.txt         # Display in reverse
head -n 10 file.txt  # First 10 lines
tail -n 10 file.txt  # Last 10 lines
less file.txt        # Scrollable view
more file.txt        # Paginated view


9 Compare Files
diff file1.txt file2.txt   # Shows differences
cmp file1.txt file2.txt    # Compares byte by byte

10 Compress and Uncompress Files
# Create tar archive
tar -cvf archive.tar file1 file2

# Extract tar archive
tar -xvf archive.tar

# Compress with gzip
gzip file.txt           # file.txt -> file.txt.gz

# Decompress gzip
gunzip file.txt.gz

# Tar + gzip
tar -czvf archive.tar.gz folder/
tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz

11 Combining and Splitting Files
# Combine files
cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt

# Split files into chunks
split -l 1000 largefile.txt part_   # 1000 lines per file
split -b 1M largefile.bin chunk_    # 1MB per file


ðŸ’¡ Tip: Use pipes and filters together for powerful command-line processing, e.g.,

cat /var/log/syslog | grep "error" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
