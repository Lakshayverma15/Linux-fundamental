✅ This module covers file editing, user management, system monitoring, process management, and maintenance—all essential 
for Linux system administrators.


1. Linux File Editors

vi text editor: Powerful command-line editor.
vi filename

Modes: i for insert, Esc for command mode, :wq to save and exit.

nano: Easier editor for beginners.
nano filename

2. sed Command

Stream editor for text manipulation.

# Replace text
sed 's/old/new/' file.txt

# Delete lines containing "error"
sed '/error/d' file.txt

3. User Account Management

Add new user:
sudo useradd username
sudo passwd username

Delete user:
sudo userdel username

View user details:
id username

4. Switch Users and Sudo Access
su - username    # Switch user
sudo command     # Execute as root
sudo su -        # Switch to root

5. Monitor Users
who              # Logged in users
w                # Active users with processes
users            # Just usernames

6. Communicate with Users
write username           # Send message to user
wall "System maintenance tonight"  # Broadcast to all users

7. Linux Directory Service & Authentication

Linux uses local files (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow) for authentication.
Enterprise options:
Active Directory (AD) – Windows-based centralized authentication.
LDAP / OpenLDAP – Lightweight Directory Access Protocol for Linux/Unix.
IDM / FreeIPA – Identity management on Linux.
WinBIND – Linux integration with AD.

8. System Utility Commands
date        # Current date and time
uptime      # System uptime
hostname    # Show hostname
which cmd   # Location of command
cal         # Calendar
bc          # Calculator

9. Processes and Scheduling

View processes:
ps aux       # Show all processes
top          # Interactive process monitor
htop         # Advanced top (if installed)

Kill processes:
kill PID
kill -9 PID  # Force kill

Manage services:
systemctl start/stop/restart service
systemctl status service

Scheduling tasks:
crontab -e   # Edit cron jobs
at 10:00     # Schedule one-time job

10. Process Management

Check running processes: ps, top
Prioritize process: nice, renice
Stop/kill process: kill, killall

11. System Monitoring Commands
top             # Real-time process monitoring
df -h           # Disk usage
dmesg           # Kernel logs
iostat 1        # CPU & I/O stats
netstat -tulnp  # Network connections
free -h         # Memory usage

12. OS Maintenance Commands
shutdown -h now       # Power off
reboot               # Restart system
halt                 # Stop all processes
init 0               # Change runlevel to shutdown

13. Changing System Hostname
hostnamectl set-hostname newname
hostname             # Verify

14. Finding System Information
uname -a                 # Kernel & OS info
cat /etc/redhat-release  # RHEL version
cat /etc/*rel*           # Release info
dmidecode                # Hardware info
arch                     # System architecture

15. Terminal Control Keys

Ctrl + C → Kill running command
Ctrl + Z → Suspend command
Ctrl + D → Logout / EOF
Ctrl + L → Clear screen

16. Terminal Commands

exit           # Logout
script logfile # Record terminal session
