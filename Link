1. Hard Link
A hard link is like another name for an existing file. Both the original file and the hard link point to the same inode (the actual data on disk).
Key Points:
•	Cannot link directories (only files).
•	Cannot link files across different file systems.
•	Deleting the original file does not delete the content if a hard link exists.
•	Both files share the same inode number.
# Hard link
ln file.txt hardlink.txt

2. Soft Link (Symbolic Link)
A soft link (or symlink) is like a shortcut to another file or directory. It points to the file name, not the inode.
Key Points:
•	Can link files and directories.
•	Can link across different file systems.
•	Deleting the original file breaks the link (it becomes a dangling link).
# Soft link (symbolic)
ln -s file.txt symlink.txt
